# TIPE - Handwritten Digits Recognition

The TIPE is a test for which preparatory class students in France are prepared. Each year a theme is imposed to all students and each student chooses a subject related to the theme.

The subject I chose is the recognition of handwritten digits by neural networks. I worked with the EMNIST handwritten digit dataset. The plan is as follows:
1. How feed forward neural networks work
2. The theoretical foundations of supervised learning
3. How I implemented neural networks without any librairies
4. Study of the influence of hyper-parameters on the classification success rate
